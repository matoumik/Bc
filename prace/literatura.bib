excitations (CCSD) is considered for the case of a spin restricted
Hartree-Fock open shell reference determinant.
A spin orbital based formulation, in which the cluster operator spans
exactly the minimal first order interacting space, is presented, and
computationally optimal working equations are given.
In the limit of a large number of closed shell orbitals,
the cost is identical to that of an optimum treatment of an equivalent closed
shell problem, which is obtained as a special case of the formulation presented.
The theory is applied to the calculation of a number of diatomic potential energ
y functions, and
compared with spin-unrestricted theory.},

This data set provides direct spectroscopic information spanning 95% of the ground X2\Sigma+ state potential well, and provides the most comprehensive spectroscopic description of this state reported to date. The analysis of this data set allows us to study the breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for a metal hydride from the minimum of the potential well to near the dissociation limit. Improved molecular constants are also determined for the A2\Pi and C2\Sigma+ states.},

  abstract = {The R -matrix method is used to perform high-level calculations of electron collisions with beryllium mono-hydride at its equilibrium geometry with a particular emphasis on electron impact electronic excitation. Several target and scattering models are considered. The calculations were performed using (1) the UKRMol suite which relies on the use of Gaussian type orbitals (GTOs) to represent the continuum and (2) using the new UKRMol+ suite which allows the inclusion of B -spline type orbitals in the basis for the continuum. The final close-coupling scattering models used the UKRMol+ code and a frozen core, valence full configuration interaction, method based on a diffuse GTO atomic basis set. The calculated electronic properties of the molecule are in very good agreement with state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations. The use of the UKRMol+ suite proved critical since it allowed the use of a large R -matrix sphere (35 Bohr), necessary to contain the diffuse electronic states of the molecule. The corresponding calculations using UKRMol are not possible due to numerical problems associated with the combination of GTO-only continuum and a large R -matrix sphere. This work provides the first demonstration of the utility and numerical stability of the new UKRMol+ code. The inelastic cross sections obtained here present a significant improvement over the results of earlier studies on BeH.},

The vibrational levels of the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-4075/30/16/009/img12.gif] anion states appear as sharp resonances in the scattering. No structure was observed in the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-4075/30/16/009/img14.gif] symmetry, but this can be attributed to the the long lifetimes and unfavourable Franck - Condon factors of the states involved.
